# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and answer
the following questions (no prior knowledge is expected).

In your answers, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write answers in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not answer with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   For now, we'll use the `rails-api` gem to create rails applications.
    `rails-api` is set to become part of Rails 5. We will never type `rails
    new`, instead preferring `rails-api new`.
